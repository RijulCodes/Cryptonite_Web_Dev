# Introduction to HTML and CSS

## Overview
This is an assignment of The Odin Project's Foundations course. It is based on two of the most fundamental technologies used in building web pages-HTML and CSS. The project focuses on how to structure content with HTML and how to style that content with the use of CSS.

## What I learned
1. Basic HTML Structure
- They now succeeded in generating the skeleton of an HTML document
- Utilized semantic HTML's tags such as: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` to structure contents
- Utilized attributes like `class` and `id` to ease use of CSS

### 2. CSS Basics
- Linked an external CSS file to the HTML document using `link` tag.
- Utilized basic CSS properties `color`, `font-size`, `padding`, `margin`, to dress the contents of an HTML.
- Learned about the selectors of CSS: element selector, class selector and ID selector for applying style to certain objects.

### 3. Box Model
Understood the concept of the CSS box model by content, padding, border, margin.
Started practicing property width and height.
- **index.html**: The main HTML that gives a very simple structure of a web page.
- **style.css**: The external CSS file that is carrying the style sheet for the HTML document.
## Future Learning
Going forward, I will practice more complicated techniques in CSS related to layout like Flexbox and Grid.
