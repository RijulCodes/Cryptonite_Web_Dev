Headings: Use <h1> to <h6> for different levels of headings, with <h1> being the most important.
Paragraphs: The <p> tag defines paragraphs and separates blocks of text.
Bold/Italic: Use <strong> or <b> for bold, and <em> or <i> for italic. Semantic tags (<strong> and <em>) are better for accessibility.
Line Breaks: The <br> tag creates a new line without starting a new paragraph.
Horizontal Rules: Use <hr> to insert a horizontal line for separating content.
Blockquotes: The <blockquote> tag is for longer quotes and usually indents the text.
Inline Quotes: The <q> tag is for short quotes, and it automatically adds quotation marks.
Preformatted Text: The <pre> tag preserves formatting and whitespace, often used for code
