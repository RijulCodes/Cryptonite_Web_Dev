1. Headings
HTML provides six heading tags, from <h1> to <h6>, used to structure content hierarchically. The most important heading is <h1>, and it typically represents the main title of the page.
2. Paragraphs
The <p> tag defines a paragraph. It's one of the most commonly used elements in HTML for separating blocks of text.
3. Bold and Italic Text
To emphasize text, you can use:
<strong> or <b> for bold text.
<em> or <i> for italicized text.
The semantic versions (<strong> and <em>) convey emphasis, which can be useful for accessibility, while <b> and <i> are purely for stylistic purposes.
4. Line Breaks
The <br> tag creates a line break within text, forcing the content to move to a new line. It's typically used within paragraphs when line breaks are necessary, without creating a new paragraph.
5. Horizontal Rules
The <hr> tag inserts a horizontal line (or rule) that visually separates content. It’s useful for dividing sections within a page.
6. Blockquotes
The <blockquote> tag is used for long quotations, and it usually indents the quoted text to indicate that it’s a separate block of content.
7. Inline Quotes
For shorter quotations, the <q> tag is used. This tag inserts quotes directly within a paragraph, and it automatically adds quotation marks around the content.
8. Preformatted Text
The <pre> tag preserves whitespace and formatting, which is useful for displaying code or text that needs to appear exactly as it’s written.
