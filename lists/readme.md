#  Lists

- **Unordered Lists**: Created using the `<ul>` tag, with each item represented by `<li>` tags. Items are displayed with bullet points.

- **Ordered Lists**: Made with the `<ol>` tag, also using `<li>` for items. This type of list displays items in a numbered format.

- **Nested Lists**: You can nest lists by placing a `<ul>` or `<ol>` inside an `<li>` of another list, allowing for sublists.

- **Description Lists**: Use the `<dl>` tag to create lists of terms and their descriptions, with `<dt>` for the term and `<dd>` for the description.

- **Accessibility**: Proper use of lists enhances the structure of content, making it easier for all users, including those with assistive technologies, to navigate and understand the information.
