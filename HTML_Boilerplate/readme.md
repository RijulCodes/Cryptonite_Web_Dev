1. **Doctype**:  
   - The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration is essential at the start of an HTML document to specify the HTML version. The modern standard is HTML5, and itâ€™s simply written as `<!DOCTYPE html>`.

2. **html Tag**:  
   - The `<html>` tag is the root element of an HTML page. It wraps all other content, including the `<head>` and `<body>` sections. It also contains the `lang` attribute, e.g., `<html lang="en">` to specify the language of the document.

3. **Head Section**:  
   - The `<head>` tag contains metadata and links to external resources. It includes:
     - `<title>`: Defines the title of the webpage shown in the browser tab.
     - `<meta charset="UTF-8">`: Ensures proper character encoding.
     - `<link>`: Used to link CSS files, favicons, etc.
   
4. **Body Section**:  
   - The `<body>` contains all the visible content of the webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and other elements that the user interacts with.

5. **Comments**:  
   - Comments are created using `<!-- comment -->` and allow developers to leave notes in the code without affecting how the page renders.

6. **Self-Closing Tags**:  
   - Tags like `<img />`, `<br />`, and `<hr />` do not require a closing tag. They are self-contained and often used for images, line breaks, and horizontal rules.
